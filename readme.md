# ðŸ’°Bean Counter

Bean counter is a node commandline tool to analys my bank transations. It take the slightly, mal-formed csv my online banking gives me and let's me view it in different ways.

It's really just a quick and dirty way for me to see where all my money has gone this month!

Create a directory called 'data' and put your csv in there and call it 'data'.

```
npm install

node index.js <args>
```

Runs the app.

`--month -m` Which month, obvs
